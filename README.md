For our Creative Coding module, the aim was to build upon and expand our knowledge of Bits & Atoms. After completing several preliminary tasks, we moved on to our main objectives: creating an interactive font and designing an unconventional micro-interaction.
Both assignments were implemented using p5.js and published on a GitHub page for showcase and exploration. This project challenged us to think creatively, break conventional usability norms, and explore the boundaries of user experience design.
