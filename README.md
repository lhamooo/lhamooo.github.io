For our Creative Coding module, the aim was to build upon and expand our knowledge of Bits & Atoms. After completing several preliminary tasks, we moved on to our main objectives: creating an interactive font and designing an unconventional micro-interaction.
Both assignments were implemented using p5.js and published on a GitHub page for showcase and exploration. This project challenged us to think creatively, break conventional usability norms, and explore the boundaries of user experience design.

## Project 1

The project revolves around the concept of mood selection. At the beginning, users are prompted to choose between three moods: happy, angry, or sad. Once a mood is selected, the interaction progresses to the next stage.

In this stage, when users type something, the letters of their input fall from the top of the screen and hover above the ground. Clicking on the screen causes the letters to gather at the center, forming the originally typed word. Clicking again triggers an "explosion," scattering the letters off-screen. After this, the experience resets, allowing the user to select a new mood.

Additional features emphasize the chosen mood. For instance:
- The background colors of the pages reflect the mood: a cheerful yellow for happiness, a fiery red for anger, and so on.
- The letter behavior changes based on the mood: letters in the sad mood tremble, while those in the happy mood appear to "dance."
- Custom fonts were selected to complement each mood, adding another layer of emotional expression.

## Project 2

This project revolves around interacting with an intentionally annoying volume control. To adjust the volume, users must first capture the balls representing the desired value.

The mechanics add complexity and frustration:

- Small numbers are contained in large balls, which move slowly, while larger numbers are in small balls that move very quickly.
- Both positive and negative values are represented in the same color, making it even harder to identify and capture the desired ball.
  
Once a ball is successfully captured, users can drag and drop it into the volume bar to either add or subtract the value displayed on the ball. This playful yet challenging interaction transforms a simple task into an engaging and unexpected experience.

## Project 3

In this project, I focused on experimenting and exploring new possibilities. I was particularly keen on trying out the textToPoints() function, which led me to create a small interactive font.

Initially, all the points representing the letters are floating randomly on the screen, and the user can interact with them using the mouse. When the mouse moves toward the center of the screen, the points come together to form the word ZHdK.

I found it fascinating to experiment with this behavior, and I think the final outcome looks visually intriguing and dynamic, adding a playful element to the interaction.
